Criteria | AI Feedback Style (Coach or AI Notes) | Score (1–5)
---|---|---
Approach Footwork | Example: “Your approach steps were smooth, but your last step was slightly short, reducing momentum. Try extending your final step for more power.” | ___
Jump Height | Example: “You reached 0.52 m on your jump, which is solid for your height. Adding more explosive push from your legs could help you reach 0.58 m.” | ___
Arm Swing Mechanics | Example: “Your arm swing reached 162° at maximum, which is excellent. Keep your elbow high during the approach to maintain this consistency.” | ___
Timing with Set | Example: “You contacted the ball 0.12s late compared to peak jump. Adjust your take-off to meet the ball at the highest point.” | ___
Contact Point | Example: “You hit the ball at 2.41 m, slightly below your max reach of 2.47 m. Extend your arm fully for maximum power.” | ___
Power and Ball Speed | Example: “Your spike generated an estimated 58 km/h ball speed. Increasing core rotation could push this to 62 km/h.” | ___
Accuracy | Example: “Target zone hit rate: 67%. Work on aiming toward the deep cross-court to improve scoring chances.” | ___
Body Control & Landing | Example: “Landing was stable with knees bent — good for injury prevention. Keep both feet aligned to improve balance recovery.” | ___
Consistency | Example: “8/10 attempts maintained correct form. Focus on matching timing with the set for every attempt.” | ___
